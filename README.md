# RideTheWaveSynth


Hello! This is a keyboard controlled synthesiser that allows you to mix different waveforms together to make an infinite variety of sounds. It also provides functionality for changing the synthesiser envelope through  ADSR parameters. 

This project was built using the JUCE library for C++. I made this project mostly to familiarize myself with the JUCE library and to deepen my knowledge of multithreaded real-time processing in C++. 

I'm working on implementing more features to the synth, including reverb, a dynamic waveform display, filters and EQ, and a better GUI. I figured that I should get this beta version out into the world so that others might get to play around with it :)


Right now, only the debug build for OSX is working because I am trying to figure out how JUCE exports across platforms.
